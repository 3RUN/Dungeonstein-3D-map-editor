# Dungeonstein-3D-map-editor

WUSIWUG tile based editor for my Dungeonstein 3D project.
This is a simple tool that helps me to create episodes for my game (with up to 10 maps per each episode).
Levels which are shaped with this tool are very simple and are similar to wolf3d maps.
Originally editor was suppose to look like Havoc's Wolf3D Editor, but then I've seen DelvEdit.
